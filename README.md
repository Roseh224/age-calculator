# **Age Calculator React App**

---

## **Overview**
This is a **React-based application** built using the **Vite build process**, with styling implemented via **CSS**. All remaining functionality is written in **JavaScript**. The project was created in **November/December 2024** as a practice exercise to refine skills in React, focusing on concepts such as:
- User input and two-way binding
- States and sharing states
- Props and lifting values

## **How It Works**
The **Age Calculator** application allows users to calculate their age (or any date difference) in specific units of time.

### **Features**
1. **Input Fields**
   - **Day**, **Month**, and **Year** fields for date entry.
2. **Unit Selector**
   - A dropdown menu with options to calculate age in:
     - **Seconds**
     - **Hours**
     - **Days**
     - **Weeks**
     - **Months**
     - **Decades**
3. **Calculate Button**
   - Clicking the button displays the result in the selected unit of time.
4. **Results Section**
   - Displays the user's age and a **birthday cake image**.
   - The number of candles varies based on the magnitude of the user's age.
   - Invalid inputs show an **error message** instead of results.

### **Validations**
- Dates **must not** be in the future.
- Date components (**day**, **month**, **year**) must be valid:
  - No negative values.
  - **Month â‰¤ 12**.
  - **Day â‰¤ valid days of the month**.
- Inputs outside the allowed range trigger an **error message**.
